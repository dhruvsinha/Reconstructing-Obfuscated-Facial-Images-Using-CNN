# Reconstructing-Obfuscated-Facial-Images-Using-Convolutional Autoencoder

Our paper aims to reconstruct obfuscated facial images. We have used a convolutional
autoencoder that takes noisy, pixelated, or blurred images as input and attempts to reconstruct recognizable facial images. For training, pixel, perceptual and a weighted combination of the two have been used as loss functions. The results demonstrate that our
trained model can successfully reconstruct facial images from highly obfuscated images,
with some limitations in clarity, relative to the ground truth.
